A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings
related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well,
that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis
on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription
from another programming language is called unpythonic.
